# Murk Core

 Core mod that my other mods depend on.

 **Limitations**:

 In order for a mod to depend on this mod, it must be manually included in [core/load_mods](core/load_mods).

 It's one of the only ways I could find to get all dependencies to share the same environment (globals, memory, etc).

 **Mods that depend on this mod**:

- [Scriptorio](https://github.com/murk108/scriptorio)

- [Murk Wire System](https://github.com/murk108/murk-wire-system)
